# Poc-Mon
A copy of the Pac-Man game in the Pokémon universe.

The goal of this project is to learn how to use the Godot 4 game engine by recreating the first few levels of Pac-Man.
We are a team of six aspiring game developpers and each of us is making their own version of Pac-Man.
I choose to make a version were the sprites are all based on the GBC Pokémon games to keep the pixel aesthetic of Pac-Man.
I may add orignal features later in developpement.
